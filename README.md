# transformer-music-generation
Transformer for generating single instrument MIDI music

This project is part of my Data Science in Layman's Terms: Time Series Analysis course.  Be sure to download the training data from <https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/maestro#v300>.  It can be unzipped in the same directory as main.py.

The best way to run the code is to set up a virtual environment and install the dependencies in requirements.txt.

```
python -m virtualenv tmg
source tmg/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
